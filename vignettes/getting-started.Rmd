### Using Mapbox GL JS

Your gateway to Mapbox GL JS v3 in R is the `mapboxgl()` function. Run the function with no arguments to get an interactive globe using Mapbox's Standard style:

```{r}
library(mapgl)

mapboxgl()
```

To use Mapbox maps, you will need a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/). If you are a user of the [mapboxapi](https://walker-data.com/mapboxapi) package and have installed your Mapbox access token, `mapboxgl()` will pick up your token for you. If you are new to my R packages, you'll want to get a token from your Mapbox account, run `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, and set the environment variable `MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN="your_token_here"`. It's important for you to know that Mapbox GL JS is a commercial product that charges you for map views; however, it does have a generous free tier.

Mapbox's default styles are accessible with the `mapbox_style()` function, and can be passed to the `style` parameter to change the style of your map. Mapbox GL JS also supports modifying map projections; here we use `projection = "winkelTripel"` for the Winkel Tripel global projection.

```{r}
mapboxgl(
  style = mapbox_style("satellite"),
  projection = "winkelTripel")
```

To get a more local view in your map, you can use the `center`, `zoom`, `pitch`, and `bearing` arguments. In the example shown below, these arguments are incorporated into a "fly to" animation. **mapgl** supports several of these animated transitions. In Mapbox GL JS v3, the new Standard style includes custom-rendered buildings around the world, such as the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mapboxgl(
  center = c(-97.6, 25.4)
) |> 
  fly_to(
    center = c(-96.810481, 32.790869),
    zoom = 18.4,
    pitch = 75,
    bearing = 136.8
  )
```

### Using Maplibre GL JS

Maplibre GL JS, a fork of the more permissively-licensed Mapbox GL JS 1.0, is also available to R users in **mapgl**. The core function to initialize a MapLibre map is `maplibre()`. The default tiles in `maplibre()` are CARTO's Voyager tiles, which are usable without an API key.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(mapgl)

maplibre()
```

[MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) tiles are also available via the `maptiler_style()` function. These styles work quite well with MapLibre, but do require an API key; set the environment variable `MAPTILER_API_KEY` in your .Renviron file to store your key. The example below uses the Bright MapTiler style, and adds a fullscreen control and a navigation control to the map.

These controls and styles are available with `mapboxgl()` as well; **mapgl** aims to provide a consistent API to work with either Mapbox or MapLibre.

```{r}
maplibre(
  style = maptiler_style("bright"),
  center = c(-43.23412, -22.91370),
  zoom = 14
) |> 
  add_fullscreen_control(position = "top-left") |> 
  add_navigation_control()
```

### Quick data visualization with view functions

If you're looking to quickly visualize spatial data without building layers from scratch, **mapgl** includes view functions that streamline the process. `mapboxgl_view()` and `maplibre_view()` automatically detect your data type and create appropriate visualizations with sensible defaults.

These functions work with **sf** objects and **terra** rasters, and will automatically style your data based on geometry type. You can also specify a column for styling, and the functions will create appropriate color scales for you.

```{r}
library(sf)

# Quick view of the North Carolina dataset
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))

maplibre_view(nc, column = "AREA")
```

If you want to add additional layers on top of a view function, you can use the `add_view()` function to stack layers. This gives you a middle ground between the quick view functions and the full layer-by-layer approach shown in the [layers overview vignette](https://walker-data.com/mapgl/articles/layers-overview.html).

### Comparing map views

**mapgl** includes a function `compare()` that allows users to create synced swipe maps that can compare two styles. This function works for either Mapbox or MapLibre maps.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m1 <- mapboxgl()
m2 <- mapboxgl(mapbox_style("satellite-streets"))

compare(m1, m2)
```
